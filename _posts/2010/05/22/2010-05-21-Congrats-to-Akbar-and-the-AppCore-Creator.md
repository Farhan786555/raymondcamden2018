Just a quick note before I start packing for my 24 hour journey across the planet. Congrats to Akbar and his <a href="http://appcorecreator.riaforge.org/">AppCore Creator</a> ColdFusion Builder extension. His entry got the most votes (and it was a darn close vote) and the grand prize winner. Thanks again to everyone who participated.
