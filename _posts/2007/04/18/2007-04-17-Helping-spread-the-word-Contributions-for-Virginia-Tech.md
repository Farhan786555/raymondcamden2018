My buddy Jim Collins sent this to me last night and I thought I'd help spread the word:

Contributions may be made at <a href="http://www.vt.edu/tragedy/memorial_fund.php">http://www.vt.edu/tragedy/memorial_fund.php</a>

The fund will be used to cover expenses including but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Grief counseling
<li>Memorials
<li>Communication expenses
<li>Comfort expenses
<li>Incidental needs 
</ul>
