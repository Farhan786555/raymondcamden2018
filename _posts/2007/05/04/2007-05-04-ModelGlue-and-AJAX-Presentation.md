I just finished my Model-Glue and AJAX presentation. Thank you to everyone who attended. I've attached the presentation and code bits below. If a user group would like this presentation in person (I mean 'in Adobe Connect'), let me know.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Cdev%2Ecamdenfamily%2Ecom%5Cenclosures%2Fmgajax%2Ezip'>Download attached file.</a></p>
