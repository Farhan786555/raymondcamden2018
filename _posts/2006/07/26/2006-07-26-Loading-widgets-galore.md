You should also take the time to check out the entries on <a href="http://blog.universalmind.com/">Andrew's blog</a> as he has some very cool Spry related stuff there.<p><a href='enclosures/D%3A%5Cwebsites%5Ccamdenfamily%5Csource%5Cmorpheus%5Cblog%5Cenclosures%2Fajax%2Dloader21%2Egif'>Download attached file.</a></p>
