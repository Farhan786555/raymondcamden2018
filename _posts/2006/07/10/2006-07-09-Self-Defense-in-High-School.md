Here is a question - why not dump volleyball or soccer in high school for a required self defense class? For girls this seems like a no-brainer, and it would be useful for boys as well. I'm not talking about karate, but simple instructions on how to be safe and defend yourself against attackers. 

Are there any high schools doing this?
