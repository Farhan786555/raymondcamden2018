I've found that my blog typically gets spammed between midnight and 6AM daily. This isn't a big deal normally as I just use the "one click delete" feature of BlogCFC to clean up the spam. Last night I got a butt load of spam though so I've decided to simply enable comment moderation before I go to bed. Hopefully this won't bug my non-American readers too much!
