When you view a UDF at CFlib, we nicely render out the parameters for the UDF, and the return value. We also auto-generate UDFDoc comments for our UDFs.

If this were to go away, would it matter to you? Obviously you would still be able to view source. Also, UDFDoc would continue to exist, it would simply be a more manual process for myself.
