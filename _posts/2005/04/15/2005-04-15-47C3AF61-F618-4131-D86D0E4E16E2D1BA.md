Another minor update:
<ul>
<li>Fixes a MS Access bug in forum.getForums(). I love joins. I especially love writing them so they work across three databases. (No, honestly, I hate SQL. Ick.)
<li>If there were no conference or forums, there was a minor layout bug in their files.
<li>In the auto-push that index.cfm does, I added addToken=false.
</ul>

Enjoy.
