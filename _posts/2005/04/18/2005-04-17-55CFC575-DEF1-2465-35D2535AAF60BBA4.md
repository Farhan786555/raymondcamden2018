A very minor BlogCFC fix has been released. Mark Denderson noted a double closing TR tag in the calendar pod. The bug occured when the last day of the month fell on a Saturday. So... honestly... this isn't my fault. I place full blame on April.

Anyway, you can download the latest build from the tools pod on the right. The only file that changed (besides the readme) is the calendar pod.
