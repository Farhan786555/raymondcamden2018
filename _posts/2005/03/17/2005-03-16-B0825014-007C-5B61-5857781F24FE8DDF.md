If you are entering the <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=48657&de=1">contest</a> at CFDJ, please do <b>NOT</b> use the zip they point to. That is the 3.5.2 version of the blog and is not the latest. Instead, please use the <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/blog354.zip">3.5.4</a> version. I'm emailing Simon now to let him know.
