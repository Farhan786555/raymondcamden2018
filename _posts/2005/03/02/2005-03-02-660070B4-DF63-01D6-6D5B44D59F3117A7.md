Ever wondered what places around you are <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=houses%20of%20ill%20repute&spn=0.220215%2C0.467004&sll=30.218018%2C-92.023618&sspn=0.055054%2C0.116751">houses of ill repute</a>? The results are pretty humorous. I started with my home address, then moved to a search and tried "houses of ill repute." As I said, the results were pretty funny. Try it yourself.
