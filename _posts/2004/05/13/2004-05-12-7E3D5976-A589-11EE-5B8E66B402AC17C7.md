If you are in the Boston area, I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.bostoncfug.com">Boston CFUG</a> on Wednesday the 19th. I'll be giving a presentation on code reuse with CFMX. This is the same presentation I gave at MAX, but with more time I will be able to share additional code samples and hopefully go more in depth.
