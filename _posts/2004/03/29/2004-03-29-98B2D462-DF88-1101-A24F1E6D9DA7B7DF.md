So, I'm going to be gone for the rest of week. I leave tomorrow morning to visit the mother ship (main office of Mindseye) up in Boston. I've been enjoying AC/shorts weather in Louisiana so I guess I  better prep myself for the freezing temperatures up there. I love Boston - but why is it always so darn cold everytime I go there?!?!?
