So, my wife and I have the family van (which I like to call the bus), but for a while now we've been talking about getting a second car. Something <i>not</i> for the kids. This weekend we went out and got a Mini Cooper.

This model was almost exactly what we had speced out at mini.com. Sunroof, cruise control, nice Harman Kardon stereo system, and other nice features as well.

It drives like a golf cart on steroids. Even driving to the inlaws is like being in a rally race. The car is just pure <i>fun</i> to drive.
