For those of you who loved the old Star Wars flight sims (X-Wing, TIE, X-Wing vs. TIE), there is a <i>free</i> game out there that mimics the Battle of Endor. You can download it <a href="http://www.theforce.net/games/apps/boendor/index.shtml">here</a>. I just spent a few seconds looking at it and it is awesome (although a bit hard to play with the mousepad).
