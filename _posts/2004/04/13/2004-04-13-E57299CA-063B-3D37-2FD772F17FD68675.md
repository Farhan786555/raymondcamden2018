The Register linked to an interesting site today. The <a href="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/">Earth Impacts Effects Program</a> allows you to determine the effect of a giant ball of whatever impacting N miles from your position. Some of the descriptions are pretty amusing. Try seeing what happens when a 10-mile wide rock crashes 100 miles away.

Now if only it had a Flash front end. :)
