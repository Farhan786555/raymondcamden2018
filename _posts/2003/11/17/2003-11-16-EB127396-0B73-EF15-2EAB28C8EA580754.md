So, I'm leaving tomorrow morning at 5:30 AM for MAX.... maybe. There is a large storm that is going to hit Lafayette right at.... 5:00 AM. So I'm guessing I'm probably going to be late getting out, or miss my connecting flight. It figures. We haven't had any storms for weeks, and a big one shows up right at the exact wrong time.
