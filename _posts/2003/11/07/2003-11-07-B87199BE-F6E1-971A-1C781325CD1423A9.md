The beta for the next major version of my blog has now been <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/blog3beta.zip">released</a>. The major new features include Access support, caching, and localization support. This version does NOT have good documentation. This version doesn't even have bad documentation, but, it's working well here. 

I'm in a rush now and will post more about the changes later, especially how I got localization in (with a LOT of help from Paul Hastings).
