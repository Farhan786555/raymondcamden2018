Yes, I'm serving up banner ads on my site. Just tring to get some kind of return for my investment of time. If everyone hates it, I'll remove them. I really like Google's ads though - they seem very non-obtrusive. If you don't mind the ads, then I certainly wouldn't mind a show of support with a click or two. Thanks. :)
