I've posted a simple custom tag, <a href="http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/downloads/slideshow.zip">SlideShow</a>, that allows you to quickly create slide shows out of directories of pictures. It supports captions and thumbnail directories (although it cheats and doesn' really resize pictures). This tag is described in full in an article that will be in a future CFDJ. For now, enjoy. If you are a parent like me you probably have around ten million pictures of your kids that you just <i>love</i> to share with everyone.
