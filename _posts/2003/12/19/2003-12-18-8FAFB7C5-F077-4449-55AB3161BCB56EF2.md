I ran across an interesting bug in HS+ 5.5 today, one that, apparently, has been around since CFS 4.5 but I somehow missed.

If you use the internal browse to view a web page and then type something, but NOT before clicking on a form field (in other words, nothing has focus), then what you type will actually go into the source code of your file. 

You can tell because the little blue X comes up that marks a document as modified. 

The engineers are aware ofthis issue, so hopefully it will be fixed in the future.
